This state mosque took eight years to construct (1892-1900). It has four minarets that resemble British clock towers. It was inaugurated by the then Sultan Ibrahim. Made of white marble and is a combination of Moorish and Victorian architecture, it can accommodate 2000 worshipers.

Learn about the different types of batik and the different significance\u0027s/meanings. To make a batik, selected areas of the cloth are blocked out by brushing or drawing hot wax over them, and the cloth is then dyed. The parts covered in wax resist the dye and remain the original color. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext visit the Royal Mausoleum, which is where the temenggongs were buried. Sultan Abu Bakar Royal Palace Museum, the marvelous Istana Besar, once the Johor royal family\u0027s principal palace, was built in Victorian style by Anglophile sultan Abu Bakar in 1866. It was opened as a museum to the public in 1990 and displays the incredible wealth of the sultans.

You will most likely have extreme love or extreme hatred for it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are many different varieties of Durian, all of which are extremely rich in nutrients.

An educational experience as well, this tour will show you an in-depth look into the life of locals who live on Kukup Island.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eKukup Island is a rustic traditional fishing village that is a total contrast from Singapore\u0027s fast paced, bustling city life. There\u0027s something special about the place that makes Singaporeans like to spend their weekends there over and over again, reconnecting with the tranquil environment of mother nature, eating fresh seafood by the sea and engaging in relaxing activities like kite flying and playing cards. In contrast to Singapore, or even the nearby Malaysian city of Johor Bahru, all life suddenly becomes slo-mo here, like entering a different world altogether.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tour begins with a visit to a fishing \"kelong\", where the locals earn their keep by breeding fish for sale. Kelongs are offshore floating wooden platforms that serve as fish farms. A local guide will show you a variety of fishes that they breed there. Watch out for the Archer fish and the Puffer fish. Archer fish feed on insects and small, land based animals by shooting at them with a powerful jet of water from their mouths, much like a sniper.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNature lovers will take delight in visiting the mangrove swamp of Pulau Kukup, said to be one of the largest mangrove swamps in the world. Visitors get to see and interact with the native birds and plants there. This swamp dissipates the hard weather elements like winds and waves, protecting Kukup Island and its natives. It also serves as a temporary home for migrant birds. Many ranges of species can be found there at different times of the year. There is a 5 storey observation point that provides a magnificent overview of the surrounding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLunch will be served at a local seafood restaurant. The seafood in Kukup is exceptionally fresh, because they are all caught live and cooked on the spot. Enjoy a wide spread of delicious food like prawns, fish, vegetables, fried rice etc (meal expenses not included). Many local seafood restaurants are built on stilts over the water, allowing guests to dine with the cool sea breeze on their faces. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter lunch, buy some local products to share with your families and friends at home. Famous products are the keropok (crackers), kueh lapis (layered cake) and belachan (shrimp paste). These products are mostly freshly hand made by the locals and have unique flavors that are sure to make all tastebuds happy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have the night to spare as well, we have an option night tour extension in which you get to light up and set off a giant sky lantern (Kong Ming Lantern) into the dark night sky.

View dozens of interactive exhibits brought alive with 3-D painting, shading and drawing techniques that create visual illusions and sensory effects. Your admission ticket gets you up close as you look beyond your initial impressions of the art, including nine locally themed paintings.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Alive Museum Singapore, originally brought from South Korea, is a 3-D visual illusion museum that opened in Singapore's Suntec City Mall in 2009. With your admission ticket, you'll experience art masterpieces that play on optical illusions called trick art, made popular during the 16th century.

View dozens of interactive exhibits brought alive with 3-D painting, shading and drawing techniques that create visual illusions and sensory effects. Your admission ticket gets you up close as you look beyond your initial impressions of the art, including nine locally themed paintings.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Alive Museum Singapore, originally brought from South Korea, is a 3-D visual illusion museum that opened in Singapore's Suntec City Mall in 2009. With your admission ticket, you'll experience art masterpieces that play on optical illusions called trick art, made popular during the 16th century. Using 3-D painting techniques, these art pieces trick the eyes and stimulate your mind into seeing both illusion and reality at the same time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, Alive Museum Singapore displays unique object art, including sculptures and installations that challenge the senses, as well as digital art pieces that combine state-of-the-art technologies and art elements to allow visitors to experience art beyond what is seen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Float on a paper boat, put on a giant pair of angel wings or lie secure in the strong arms of Superman during an immersive experience. Find Pose Point and Photo Point icons at each art exhibit, then pose and click to achieve the best and most realistic-looking pictures. Take advantage of the free WiFi provided to upload and share the fun snapshots immediately with your friends and family on various social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</ns2:addonDescription><ns2:mmtPreferred>false</ns2:mmtPreferred><ns2:onlyForAdults>false</ns2:onlyForAdults><ns2:currency>USD</ns2:currency><ns2:duration>0.0</ns2:duration><ns2:fixedCost>0.0</ns2:fixedCost><ns2:durationInHrs>0</ns2:durationInHrs><ns2:tnc>NA</ns2:tnc><ns2:adultCost>11.45</ns2:adultCost><ns2:childCost>9.82</ns2:childCost><ns2:infantCost>0.0</ns2:infantCost><ns2:adultBaseCost>11.11</ns2:adultBaseCost><ns2:childBaseCost>9.52</ns2:childBaseCost><ns2:infantBaseCost>0.0</ns2:infantBaseCost><ns2:adultMarkUpCost>0.0</ns2:adultMarkUpCost><ns2:childMarkUpCost>0.0</ns2:childMarkUpCost><ns2:infantMarkUpCost>0.0</ns2:infantMarkUpCost><ns2:familyCost>0.0</ns2:familyCost><ns2:sellingCost>11.45</ns2:sellingCost><ns2:maxPaxCount>999</ns2:maxPaxCount><ns2:dayApplicable>0</ns2:dayApplicable><ns2:rateCurrencyId><ns2:id>40</ns2:id><ns2:fromCurrency>USD</ns2:fromCurrency><ns2:toCurrency>INR</ns2:toCurrency><ns2:rateOfExchange>68.7543</ns2:rateOfExchange></ns2:rateCurrencyId><ns2:city><ns2:id>2514</ns2:id><ns2:valid>false</ns2:valid><ns2:name>Singapore</ns2:name></ns2:city><ns2:cityCode>SIN</ns2:cityCode><ns2:countryCode>SG</ns2:countryCode><ns2:selected>false</ns2:selected><ns2:privateTransfer>false</ns2:privateTransfer><ns2:addonImagesUrl>http://www.dynamic.viator.com/graphicslib/3695/SITours/experience-trick-art-alive-museum-singapore-admission-in-singapore-163620.jpg;http://www.dynamic.viator.com/graphicslib/3695/SITours/experience-trick-art-alive-museum-singapore-admission-in-singapore-163620.jpg;</ns2:addonImagesUrl><ns2:pkgB2CDiff>1581</ns2:pkgB2CDiff><ns2:pkgOpaqueDiff>1700</ns2:pkgOpaqueDiff><ns2:addonOpaquePrice>1528</ns2:addonOpaquePrice><ns2:addonB2CPrice>1581</ns2:addonB2CPrice><ns2:totalFlightPerPaxB2CPrice>17390</ns2:totalFlightPerPaxB2CPrice><ns2:totalHotelsPerPaxB2CPrice>16822</ns2:totalHotelsPerPaxB2CPrice><ns2:totalRemainingPerPaxB2CPrice>14273</ns2:totalRemainingPerPaxB2CPrice><ns2:beforeMazorTpt>false</ns2:beforeMazorTpt><ns2:variableDayLeftOffset>0</ns2:variableDayLeftOffset><ns2:variableDayRightOffset>0</ns2:variableDayRightOffset><ns2:inclusions>&lt;ul&gt;

View dozens of interactive exhibits brought alive with 3-D painting, shading and drawing techniques that create visual illusions and sensory effects. Your admission ticket gets you up close as you look beyond your initial impressions of the art, including nine locally themed paintings.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Alive Museum Singapore, originally brought from South Korea, is a 3-D visual illusion museum that opened in Singapore's Suntec City Mall in 2009. With your admission ticket, you'll experience art masterpieces that play on optical illusions called trick art, made popular during the 16th century. Using 3-D painting techniques, these art pieces trick the eyes and stimulate your mind into seeing both illusion and reality at the same time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, Alive Museum Singapore displays unique object art, including sculptures and installations that challenge the senses, as well as digital art pieces that combine state-of-the-art technologies and art elements to allow visitors to experience art beyond what is seen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Float on a paper boat, put on a giant pair of angel wings or lie secure in the strong arms of Superman during an immersive experience. Find Pose Point and Photo Point icons at each art exhibit, then pose and click to achieve the best and most realistic-looking pictures. Take advantage of the free WiFi provided to upload and share the fun snapshots immediately with your friends and family on various social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</ns2:addonDescription><ns2:mmtPreferred>false</ns2:mmtPreferred><ns2:onlyForAdults>false</ns2:onlyForAdults><ns2:currency>USD</ns2:currency><ns2:duration>0.0</ns2:duration><ns2:fixedCost>0.0</ns2:fixedCost><ns2:durationInHrs>0</ns2:durationInHrs><ns2:tnc>NA</ns2:tnc><ns2:adultCost>11.45</ns2:adultCost><ns2:childCost>9.82</ns2:childCost><ns2:infantCost>0.0</ns2:infantCost><ns2:adultBaseCost>11.11</ns2:adultBaseCost><ns2:childBaseCost>9.52</ns2:childBaseCost><ns2:infantBaseCost>0.0</ns2:infantBaseCost><ns2:adultMarkUpCost>0.0</ns2:adultMarkUpCost><ns2:childMarkUpCost>0.0</ns2:childMarkUpCost><ns2:infantMarkUpCost>0.0</ns2:infantMarkUpCost><ns2:familyCost>0.0</ns2:familyCost><ns2:sellingCost>11.45</ns2:sellingCost><ns2:maxPaxCount>999</ns2:maxPaxCount><ns2:dayApplicable>0</ns2:dayApplicable><ns2:rateCurrencyId><ns2:id>40</ns2:id><ns2:fromCurrency>USD</ns2:fromCurrency><ns2:toCurrency>INR</ns2:toCurrency><ns2:rateOfExchange>68.7543</ns2:rateOfExchange></ns2:rateCurrencyId><ns2:city><ns2:id>2514</ns2:id><ns2:valid>false</ns2:valid><ns2:name>Singapore</ns2:name></ns2:city><ns2:cityCode>SIN</ns2:cityCode><ns2:countryCode>SG</ns2:countryCode><ns2:selected>false</ns2:selected><ns2:privateTransfer>false</ns2:privateTransfer><ns2:addonImagesUrl>http://www.dynamic.viator.com/graphicslib/3695/SITours/experience-trick-art-alive-museum-singapore-admission-in-singapore-163620.jpg;http://www.dynamic.viator.com/graphicslib/3695/SITours/experience-trick-art-alive-museum-singapore-admission-in-singapore-163620.jpg;</ns2:addonImagesUrl><ns2:pkgB2CDiff>1581</ns2:pkgB2CDiff><ns2:pkgOpaqueDiff>1701</ns2:pkgOpaqueDiff><ns2:addonOpaquePrice>1528</ns2:addonOpaquePrice><ns2:addonB2CPrice>1581</ns2:addonB2CPrice><ns2:totalFlightPerPaxB2CPrice>17390</ns2:totalFlightPerPaxB2CPrice><ns2:totalHotelsPerPaxB2CPrice>16822</ns2:totalHotelsPerPaxB2CPrice><ns2:totalRemainingPerPaxB2CPrice>22061</ns2:totalRemainingPerPaxB2CPrice><ns2:beforeMazorTpt>false</ns2:beforeMazorTpt><ns2:variableDayLeftOffset>0</ns2:variableDayLeftOffset><ns2:variableDayRightOffset>0</ns2:variableDayRightOffset><ns2:inclusions>&lt;ul&gt;

View dozens of interactive exhibits brought alive with 3-D painting, shading and drawing techniques that create visual illusions and sensory effects. Your admission ticket gets you up close as you look beyond your initial impressions of the art, including nine locally themed paintings.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Alive Museum Singapore, originally brought from South Korea, is a 3-D visual illusion museum that opened in Singapore's Suntec City Mall in 2009. With your admission ticket, you'll experience art masterpieces that play on optical illusions called trick art, made popular during the 16th century.

View dozens of interactive exhibits brought alive with 3-D painting, shading and drawing techniques that create visual illusions and sensory effects. Your admission ticket gets you up close as you look beyond your initial impressions of the art, including nine locally themed paintings.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Alive Museum Singapore, originally brought from South Korea, is a 3-D visual illusion museum that opened in Singapore's Suntec City Mall in 2009. With your admission ticket, you'll experience art masterpieces that play on optical illusions called trick art, made popular during the 16th century. Using 3-D painting techniques, these art pieces trick the eyes and stimulate your mind into seeing both illusion and reality at the same time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, Alive Museum Singapore displays unique object art, including sculptures and installations that challenge the senses, as well as digital art pieces that combine state-of-the-art technologies and art elements to allow visitors to experience art beyond what is seen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Float on a paper boat, put on a giant pair of angel wings or lie secure in the strong arms of Superman during an immersive experience. Find Pose Point and Photo Point icons at each art exhibit, then pose and click to achieve the best and most realistic-looking pictures. Take advantage of the free WiFi provided to upload and share the fun snapshots immediately with your friends and family on various social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</ns2:addonDescription><ns2:mmtPreferred>false</ns2:mmtPreferred><ns2:onlyForAdults>false</ns2:onlyForAdults><ns2:currency>USD</ns2:currency><ns2:duration>0.0</ns2:duration><ns2:fixedCost>0.0</ns2:fixedCost><ns2:durationInHrs>0</ns2:durationInHrs><ns2:tnc>NA</ns2:tnc><ns2:adultCost>11.45</ns2:adultCost><ns2:childCost>9.82</ns2:childCost><ns2:infantCost>0.0</ns2:infantCost><ns2:adultBaseCost>11.11</ns2:adultBaseCost><ns2:childBaseCost>9.52</ns2:childBaseCost><ns2:infantBaseCost>0.0</ns2:infantBaseCost><ns2:adultMarkUpCost>0.0</ns2:adultMarkUpCost><ns2:childMarkUpCost>0.0</ns2:childMarkUpCost><ns2:infantMarkUpCost>0.0</ns2:infantMarkUpCost><ns2:familyCost>0.0</ns2:familyCost><ns2:sellingCost>11.45</ns2:sellingCost><ns2:maxPaxCount>999</ns2:maxPaxCount><ns2:dayApplicable>0</ns2:dayApplicable><ns2:rateCurrencyId><ns2:id>40</ns2:id><ns2:fromCurrency>USD</ns2:fromCurrency><ns2:toCurrency>INR</ns2:toCurrency><ns2:rateOfExchange>68.7543</ns2:rateOfExchange></ns2:rateCurrencyId><ns2:city><ns2:id>2514</ns2:id><ns2:valid>false</ns2:valid><ns2:name>Singapore</ns2:name></ns2:city><ns2:cityCode>SIN</ns2:cityCode><ns2:countryCode>SG</ns2:countryCode><ns2:selected>false</ns2:selected><ns2:privateTransfer>false</ns2:privateTransfer><ns2:addonImagesUrl>http://www.dynamic.viator.com/graphicslib/3695/SITours/experience-trick-art-alive-museum-singapore-admission-in-singapore-163620.jpg;http://www.dynamic.viator.com/graphicslib/3695/SITours/experience-trick-art-alive-museum-singapore-admission-in-singapore-163620.jpg;</ns2:addonImagesUrl><ns2:pkgB2CDiff>1581</ns2:pkgB2CDiff><ns2:pkgOpaqueDiff>1700</ns2:pkgOpaqueDiff><ns2:addonOpaquePrice>1528</ns2:addonOpaquePrice><ns2:addonB2CPrice>1581</ns2:addonB2CPrice><ns2:totalFlightPerPaxB2CPrice>17390</ns2:totalFlightPerPaxB2CPrice><ns2:totalHotelsPerPaxB2CPrice>16822</ns2:totalHotelsPerPaxB2CPrice><ns2:totalRemainingPerPaxB2CPrice>16757</ns2:totalRemainingPerPaxB2CPrice><ns2:beforeMazorTpt>false</ns2:beforeMazorTpt><ns2:variableDayLeftOffset>0</ns2:variableDayLeftOffset><ns2:variableDayRightOffset>0</ns2:variableDayRightOffset><ns2:inclusions>&lt;ul&gt;
